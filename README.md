🧠 SAM – Your AI Robot Assistant

SAM (Smart AI Machine) is a futuristic personal assistant inspired by Tony Stark’s Jarvis. It is designed to interact with users through voice and text, execute system and online tasks, and provide a futuristic interface with 3D model support. SAM is built entirely in Python, with plans for deployment on devices like Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano.
